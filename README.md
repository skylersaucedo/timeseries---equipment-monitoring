Sporadic power interruptions have deleteriously contributed to the pumping efficiency and flow of lubricant to the gears, adding strain to the system’s capacity to dissipate heat and maintain pressure.

A slow, decrease in gearbox pressure suggests a potential mechanical failure may be imminent. There is less pressure at the gearbox than what is expected, and with this, less lubricant circulating through the system.

There is a gradual increase in the variance of the temperature during this time, hinting at the system’s increased difficulty to lubricate the gears and maintain nominal behavior and a stable temperature.

Detector senses anomalous behavior at 11/7 20h, with an increasing detector score during the onset of failure.
